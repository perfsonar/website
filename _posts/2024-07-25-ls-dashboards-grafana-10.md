The perfSONAR public dashboard (aka Lookup Service dashboard) has just been upgraded.
Thanks to Grafana 10 a new browsing UI has been implemented with improved filtering
capabilities. It still lists all the perfSONAR public instances and provides useful
statistics about those deployments so that perfSONAR users can find the best suited
target perfSONAR node to make measurements.

Go ahead and [test for yourself at https://stats.perfsonar.net](https://stats.perfsonar.net)!

We welcome your feedback [on the perfSONAR user list](https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/info/perfsonar-user).
