The Third European perfSONAR User Workshop will follow on from the
first two workshops and again will bring together perfSONAR user and
developer communities to explore use cases for the toolkit, to share
best practices, and to discuss future features and the perfSONAR
development roadmap.

The Workshop is being organised by the [GÉANT GN4-3 project](https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT_Project_GN4-3),
Work Package 6 "[Network Technologies and Services Development](https://wiki.geant.org/display/NETDEV/NETDEV+Home)",
