Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### Perl Shared Libraries

-   Fixed issue where an update to the perl-Mojolicious package broke
    all Perl clients using https. This included the graphs, pSConfig and
    checks run by MaDDash.

### Toolkit

-   Fixed issue where auto-updates were re-enabled on update of
    perfsonar-toolkit package if yum-cron was not disabled with
    *systemctl disable yum-cron* but instead just /etc/yum/yum-cron.conf
    file was modified
-   Fixed issue where files under /usr/lib/perfsonar/web-ng/etc were
    replaced on update

### Graphs

-   Fixed issue where attenpts to point the graphs at an esmond instance
    running https complained about a missing perl-LWP-Protocol-https
    dependency
-   Fixed issue where using https to access esmond returned a "write
    error".

### pSConfig

-   Fixed bracketing of IPv6 address in URLs when the address is
    included in the URL as the result of a template varible expansion.
