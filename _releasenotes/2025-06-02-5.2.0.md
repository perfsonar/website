Features and Highlights
------------------------

### Ubuntu24 Support

This is the first release to include packages specifically built for Ubuntu 24. 

### ARM64 Docker Image

This is the first release to include support for an ARM64 version of the perfsonar-testpoint docker image. You can retrieve the beta image from GitHub's image repository with `docker pull ghcr.io/perfsonar/testpoint:v5.2.0`. 

Note about Upcoming Ethr Migration
----------------------------------
We have resolved some of the problems that have kept us using Ethr 0.2.1 for the last several years and are now able to upgrade what we ship to 1.0.0. This is a very-recent development and still has some interoperability problems (0.2.1 and 1.0.0 are incompatible). We would like to make part of the 5.2 family of releases so users of Ethr don't have to wait until 5.3. We will, therefore, take the unusual step of bringing this change in as part of a bugfix release on or about August 4. This release will contain both versions of Ethr and code in its pScheduler plugin to interoperate with the old one. We are still working out the interoperability and will give you plenty of notice if we have to drop back to a "break everything" moment. Backward compatibility with Ethr 0.2.1 will be removed next year in perfSONAR 5.3.

Bug Fixes and Other Changes
---------------------

### Archive
- Upgraded to OpenSearch 2.18.0
- Converted Elmond to WSGI which also corrects issue on IPv6-only hosts

### Grafana
- Upgraded to Grafana 11.2.9
- Fixed issue where IPv6 address was not shown on pages that show host information 
- Fixed display issue where maximum of Y axis for packet loss was 10000%
- Fixed display issue where 100Gbps interface speed information did not fit well on the screen
- Fixed issue with Grafana not starting on reboot
- Updated Matrix panel to latest plugin version which fixes various visual bugs.
- Added swap space graph to Host Info page
- Added a soft minimum of 0 to all graphs on endpoint pages. This means the Y axis will start at 0 unless there is a negative number. 

### Host Metrics
- Converted to WSGI which also corrects issue on IPv6-only hosts

### pScheduler
- Fixed issue where tasks would not run due to an issue with PostgreSQL notifications.
- Fixed issues in trace plugin where hostnames contain underscores
- Fixed issue where MTU was not appearing in trace output
- Fixed issue with internal HTTP queue listener 
- Updated tracepath tool to work in IPv6 testing scenarios where tracepath6 is not present
- Fixed issue on EL9 where perfSONAR install would fail because newer PostgreSQL versions were not starting
- Improved internal clock API when ntpd not present
- Fixed issue on newer systems where `pscheduler plot-schedule` would produce an empty png file
- Fixed issues enabling debug output on some systems
- Fixed overly noisy logs when building plots of schedule
- Fixed issue where non-ASCII characters were not properly being handled in JSON
- Fixed issue in `simplestream` test where it was not honoring IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
- Added a timeout parameter to the HTTP archiver which defaults to 30 seconds (PT30S). Using this parameter requires specifying schema 4.
- Improvements to how linuxvrf and linuxnns contexts use the ip setting
- Fixed issue where 'schema' not set properly when sendings tasks with`priority` set to pscheduler
- Fixed issue where `--fq-rate` option was not properly passed to iperf3
- Upgraded to iperf3 3.18
- Install htcp kernel module on EL9
- Added an `archiving-summary` command that summarizes success/failure of archiving for a given period (default one hour)
- Upgraded jq to 1.7
- Created a pscheduler-bundle-minimal that only installs a minimally-functional pScheduler.
- The `pscheduler ping` command can be run without arguments to ping pScheduler on the local system.
- Fixed issue with CLI output of non-default bucket widths for latencybg tests


### pSConfig
- Improved error messages in `psconfig stats` command
- Fixed missing perfsonar-command depenedency in utils package
- Fixed issue in logging configuration that prevent pSConfig from starting on Oracle Linux 8.
- Updated logging configuration that was using old configuration to a new format so that they properly rotate log files.
- Include RTT graphs in generated Endpoint Pair Explorer for matrices
- Changed default time setting to 24 hours for generated Grafana graphs to better align with common throughput testing schedules
- Added --no-headers option to `psconfig remote list` command so that it only outputs JSON
- Added support for pscheduler-like JSON comments
- Fixed issue where lead-bind-address was not properly being sent to pscheduler
- Added support for `runs` attribute in archive definition in order to match pscheduler archive definition
- Fixed issue where Grafana thresholds with priorities were not properly getting evaluated

### Toolkit
- Fixed issue on Debian and Ubuntu where default archiver definition was not properly created which led to missing inbound tests when creating them from Toolkit web interface
- Fixed SELinux issue preventing LS registration file from being updated by UI on EL9.
