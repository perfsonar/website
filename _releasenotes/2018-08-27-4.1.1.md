Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### Perl Shared Libraries

-   Corrected schema files used to validate old MeshConfig files to be
    less strict about location and administrator field requirements.
    This solves issues where pSConfig agents could not read old files
    because they could not validate them.
-   Fixed timeout handling race condition that could lead to unhandled
    SIGALRM that quietly stops pSConfig daemons
-   Corrected issue that caused Toolkit WebUI to sometimes choose a link
    local IPv6 address for tests

### pScheduler

-   Improved propagation of debug and logging state between processes.
-   Removed extraneous validation of BWCTL tests that made things
    difficult for tasks with specific binding requirements
-   Fixed file descriptior issue that coulkd prevent pScheduler from
    connecting to the database is some cases

### pSConfig

-   Updated schema documents to reflect changes in the perl shared
    libraries

### Toolkit

-   Fixed syntax errors in migration scripts
