Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### pScheduler
 - Improved performance of archiver under high loads
 - Fixed a memory leak in a third-party library
 - Adjusted behavior of curl tool to match that in the now-retired psurl
 - Better error handling when task requested with unsupported tool

### Graphs
 - Fixed potential SSRF issue in graphData.cgi

### Traceroute Viewer
 - Fixed issue where MA responses were not properly encoded
 - Fixed potential SSRF issue in index.cgi

### Docker
- A new perfsonar-testpoint docker image is available based on systemd instead of supervisord. This is generally more stable for long-running installations and more consistent with other non-Docker installs. The supervisord version continues to be available. See the document [here](https://docs.perfsonar.net/install_docker.html#running-the-systemd-image) for how to use the new image.
