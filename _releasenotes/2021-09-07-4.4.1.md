Bug Fixes and Changes
----------------------------

### End of Ubuntu 16 support
- As [free support of Ubuntu 16](https://ubuntu.com/16-04) is not available anymore, we won't provide any further upgrade to perfSONAR systems running on Ubuntu 16.  We recommend you to [upgrade to Ubuntu 18 or reinstall your perfSONAR node afresh](https://docs.perfsonar.net/install_debian.html) with one of the OS we support.

### pScheduler
- Adjusted iperf3 tool to attempt to terminate stray, orphaned server processes before running.
- Fixed a problem with throughput tests run in loopback mode with iperf3
- Improved handling of internal notifications to avoid missing runs scheduled on a short fuse.
- Fixed issue where runner did not log complete exception
- Updated issue where pscheduler-scheduler did not have a proper PID file
- Fixed divide by 0 error in Ethr plugin
