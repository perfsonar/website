Features
--------

### Python 3 Support

- This release focuses on upgrading to Python 3. This change is necessary since all versions of Python 2 are considered end-of-life. This brings with it many changes to the perfSONAR code and package depedencies. In particular the pScheduler and esmond components are the most affected since they are the largest Python components. To learn more about the Python 2 end-of-life [here](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). 

### PWA support for More Archiver Types

- The pSConfig Web Administrator (PWA) has been updated to support more archivers beyond Esmond. It now includes suppport for setting-up a RabbitMQ archiver as well as an advanced option to define a an archiver using a raw JSON definition which should allow use of any pScheduler-supported archiver plug-in. 

### S3 Benchmark Test and Tool

- Added a s3throughput test and a corresponding tool for measuring throughput of S3-compatible object storage services. *NOTE: This tool is not currently available for Debian based distributions running arm64 or ppc64el architectures.*

### Ethr throughput tool plugin

- Added throughput testing with [Ethr](https://github.com/microsoft/ethr). Note that because Ethr does not support bandwidth constraints, this plugin does not either and will decline to participate in any test with a bandwidth parameter.

### pScheduler Batch Processor

- Added a 'batch' command that allows multiple pScheduler jobs to be done serially or in parallel and returns the results as a single unit.

Bug Fixes and Changes
