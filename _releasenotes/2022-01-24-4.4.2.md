Bug Fixes and Changes
----------------------------

### pScheduler
- The nuttcp tool plugin now favors bandwidth limits over burst size if both are in effect. This works around a deficiency in nuttcp itself.
- Added a --assist-bind switch to the task parameter that allows separate control over binding when contacting an assist server. (The old behavior was to use the value of --bind.)
- Bumped the version of jq to force some older systems to upgrade properly.
