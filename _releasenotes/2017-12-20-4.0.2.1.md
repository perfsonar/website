Detailed Bug Fixes and Changes
------------------------------

### General

-   Updated Debian packages and RPMs to remove dependency on the perl
    Net::Ping::External package. This caused issues primarily for Debian
    installs since the dependency was removed from the main Debian repos
    recently so installs could not complete. We made a parallel change
    in the RPMs to keep things consistent. The updated packages are
    perfsonar-lsregistrationdaemon, perfsonar-lscachedaemon, and all
    packages starting with perfsonar-toolkit or libperfsonar.

### Esmond

-   Uploaded new esmond packages that correct a race condition between
    cassandra start-up and the esmond set-up scripts. This error led a
    number of users to reporting their esmond database scripts were not
    setup correctly when doing a fresh install. If you encountered this
    error prior to this email you should be able to correct it with a
    “/usr/lib/perfsonar/scripts/system\_environment/configure\_esmond
    —force” command followed by a “systemctl restart httpd”. Note that
    if you are running the latest esmond RPM you should not need to
    comment any part of the configure\_esmond script as was indicated
    for the older version of the script in a previous note to the users
    list.
