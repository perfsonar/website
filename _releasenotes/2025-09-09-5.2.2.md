Bug Fixes and Other Changes
---------------------


### Grafana
- Upgraded Matrix Panel plugin to fix bug where tooltip would remain after clicking box in matrix

### pScheduler
- Fixed issue where `pscheduler troubleshoot` would always return `Never` for last run completed.
- Updated the PNG file returned by the `/schedule` endpoint to set the `Content-Type` header

### pSConfig
- Fixed issue where graph page would not be create on first run of pSConfig Grafana agent due to an errant `id` field in the template used to create the page
- Added support for non-background latency tasks in psConfig Grafana agents. On update the configuration file with this change wil not get copied so it does not override any changes you have made to the `/etc/perfsonar/psconfig/grafana-agent.json` file. Either merge the new block by hand or add the grafana-user and grafana-password settings from the old file to the new one. 
- Removed log messages about being unable to perform reverse lookups on local addresses. 

## Toolkit
- Fixed issue in Deb packages where apache_reload had a syntax error.
