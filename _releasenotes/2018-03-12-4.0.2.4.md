Detailed Bug Fixes and Changes
------------------------------

### Toolkit

-   Fixed issue with perfsonar-configdaemon on CentOS 7 where
    configuration through the Toolkit GUI could not be saved because the
    daemon was only listening on ::1 and the client was trying to
    connect to 127.0.0.1. This was caused by an update to the
    perl-HTTP-Daemon library.
