Features/Changes
----------------

### pSConfig

-   pSConfig is a new component that replaces the old MeshConfig
    component. It is a template framework for defining the tasks to be
    run by hosts. The templates can be used to not only configure the
    tasks on each host through pScheduler but also to display their
    results through MaDDash. See the introduction to pSConfig
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/psconfig_intro.html)
    for more information.
-   Some major benefits of pSConfig include:
    -   **Increased Extensibility** - pSConfig can take full advantage
        of the extensibility provided by pScheduler. It supports any
        test, archiver or context plug-in installed on your pScheduler
        server. Best of all, as more plug-ins get added, no software
        update is required for pSConfig!
    -   **Consolidated Configuration Format** - pSConfig defines all the
        tasks to be run in a JSON format it refers to as a template.
        There is no conversion between various file formats required as
        there was in MeshConfig. No longer do you need to edit an Apache
        Config-like format and convert it to JSON nor edit yet another
        format referred to a meshconfig-agent-tasks.conf for you local
        agent. Now there is only one format required no matter where the
        template lives.
    -   **Enhanced Control** - pSConfig gives increased control over
        what each agent does. This includes not only familiar operations
        like defining archives locally, but also allows for
        agent-defined transforms of any aspect of the templates after
        they are downloaded. See the documentation
        [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/psconfig_pscheduler_agent.html#modifying-templates)
        for more information
    -   **Better Diagnostics** - pSConfig formats all logs of its agents
        in a parsable format. It also provides command-line utilities to
        help extract useful information from the logs. See the
        documentation for the [pscheduler
        agent](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/psconfig_pscheduler_agent.html#troubleshooting)
        and [maddash
        agent](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/psconfig_maddash_agent.html#troubleshooting)
        for examples.
-   The **pSConfig Web Administrator** (PWA) is a separate component
    that provides a web interface for creating pSConfig templates. It is
    a revision of the former MeshConfig Administrator component that
    entered beta with version 4.0. As such, it can also generate the old
    MeshConfig format for tests using options supported by both formats.
    For more information see the documentation
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/pwa.html).
-   pSConfig uses a completely new JSON format to define templates. That
    being said, it is capable of reading files in the old MeshConfig
    format. This should give some flexibility in terms of when you
    migrate. It is recommended you migrate as soon as all your agents
    are updated to 4.1, since support for the old format will be dropped
    **6 months after the next major release**. For more information on
    migration see the document
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/psconfig_meshconfig_migrate.html).

### TWAMP

-   The Two-Way Active Management Protocol (TWAMP), described in [RFC
    5357](index.html), is an extension of the One-Way Active Management
    Protocol (OWAMP) that supplies two-way or round-trip measurements
    instead of unidirectional capabilities. TWAMP measurements are
    helpful because round-trip delays do not require host clock
    synchronization but can still provide additional accuracy compared
    to tools such as ping. It has the additional advantage that many
    routers are capable of running a vendor's implementation of a TWAMP
    server.
-   A pscheduler plug-in is available named *pscheduler-tool-twping* for
    running tests of type latency or rtt. Periodic measurements can be
    setup via the pScheduler CLI, pSConfig Web Administrator or through
    pSConfig templates setup by hand by specifying tool *twping*

### Docker Support

-   Docker containers will be supported in 4.1 final release for *tools*
    and *testpoint* bundles. See the documentation
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/install_docker.html)
    for more details.

### pScheduler Updates

-   Added support for task re-writing to make on-the-fly changes to
    tasks at ingest to supplement the limit system.
-   Added support for "single-ended" throughput tests that allow for
    testing to a server not running pScheduler.
-   Improved the *pscheduler troubleshoot* command to check the maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) as well as enhanced options for checking on
    IPv4 vs IPv6.
-   Added an *http* test and associated tools for measuring various HTTP
    performance metrics

### BWCTL Deprecation

-   BWCTL is no longer included in new installations of perfSONAR but
    will be left untouched on existing installations. For a complete
    discussion of BWCTL support including timelines and options see the
    [upgrade
    notes](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/manage_update.html#bwctl-support).

### CentOS 6 Deprecation

-   CentOS 6 is not supported for version 4.1. See the documentation
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/manage_update.html#centos-6-support-discontinued)
    for a full discussion of CentOS 6 support and perfSONAR.

### Debian 7 Deprecation

-   Debian 7 is not supported for version 4.1. See the documentation
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.1b1/manage_update.html#debian-7-support-discontiuned)
    for a full discussion of Debian 7 support and perfSONAR.
