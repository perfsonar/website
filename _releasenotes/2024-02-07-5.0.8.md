Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### pScheduler

- Changed pscheduler systemd unit files from type exec to simple on EL7. EL7 does not support a new enough version of systemd for the exec unit type.

### Toolkit

- Fixed issue where systemd-resolved was taking precedence over /etc/hosts which would cause certain process to run slowly
- The toolkit no longer disables NetworkManager on EL9.
