Features
--------


### New pScheduler Disk-to-Disk Test

-   pScheduler supports a new test type called *disk-to-disk* that
    includes GridFTP and curl tools. For more information on using this
    new feature see the document
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.2.0/pscheduler_disk_to_disk.html).

### pSConfig Web Admin (PWA) RPMs

-   pSConfig Web Admin is now available as RPM packages. This provides
    an alternative to the existing docker containers. See the document
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.2.0/pwa_install_rpm.html)
    for details.

### perfSONAR Ansible Roles

-   Supported Ansible roles are now available to help automate your
    perfSONAR deployment and customize it to meet your needs. See the
    document
    [here](https://github.com/perfsonar/ansible-playbook-perfsonar/blob/master/README.md)
    for details.

### pScheduler Task Priorities

-   pScheduler is now able to apply priority to tasks. The primary use
    case for this feature is to allow tests run from the command-line to
    more quickly get a time slot in cases where the schedule is full.
    See the document
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.2.0/config_pscheduler_limits.html#priorities-which-runs-happen-and-which-do-not)
    for details.

### MaDDash ServiceNow Integration

-   MaDDash is now able to create and manage records in ServiceNow. See
    the document
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.2.0/maddash_config_server.html#notifications)
    for details.

### pSConfig Enhancements

-   The pSConfig MaDDash agent can now create dashboards for HTTP and
    DNS tests using default settings.
-   The *psconfig validate* command now does more thorough validation of
    pSConfig templates. This includes validating references and asking
    pScheduler to validate archivers, tests and contexts.
-   Added a new *psconfig agenctl* command to make interacting with the
    pSConfig pScheduler and MaDDash agent easier.

### Lookup Service Enhancements

-   Added support for bulk renewals. This should significantly decrease
    messaging on clients.
-   Added support for signing records to provide a mechanism for
    validating who registered a particular record.

### End of BWCTL pScheduler Support

-   This release marks the final phase of BWCTL deprecation in
    perfSONAR. This version removes remaining support for backward
    compatibility with BWCTL. Older systems with tools supporting BWCTL
    installed will receive upgrades that makes them inert. See
    [docs.perfsonar.net](http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#bwctl-support)
    for full details of this process.

### Debian 8 and Ubuntu 14 Deprecation

-   Debian 8 and Ubuntu 14 are not supported for version 4.2. See the
    documentation
    [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#debian-8-and-ubuntu-14-support-discontinued)
    for a full discussion of Debian 8 and Ubuntu 14 support and
    perfSONAR.
