Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### Perl Shared Libraries

-   Fixed issue with translation of MeshConfig to pSConfig where a
    default *slip* was not set unless the MeshConfig format had
    explicitly set a *slip* or *random\_start\_percentage*. For many
    users this led to an inability to run throughput tests since a
    time-slot could not be found. The translation will now set a default
    *slip* equal to the *test-interval*.

### Graphs

-   Fixed issue where latency values were not displayed correctly if a
    *bucket-width* other than .001 was given

### Toolkit

-   Fixed issue where new Toolkit installs did not open data ports for
    iperf3, iperf, nuttcp or simplestreamer in firewall because those
    ports ranges previously came from the no-longer installed BWCTL
    config file.
-   The migration script used to move from CentOS 6 to CentOS 7 now runs
    the *configure\_esmond* command to make sure the auth-token in
    configuration files is consistent with the database

### pSConfig

-   Version was increased with no other changes in order to force a
    restart of agents so they will pick up changes in perl shared
    libraries

### Bundles

-   Version increase for package consistency
