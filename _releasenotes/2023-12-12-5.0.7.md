Bug Fixes and Changes
----------------------------

### Archive

- Added automatic restart attempts to both Opensearch and Logstash in systemd unit files.

### Lookup Service Registration Daemon

- Fixed issue in Debian/Ubuntu where lsregistrationdaemon.conf file would be moved on update if it had any changes from the default file. If you run into this issue perform the following:
```
cp /etc/perfsonar/lsregistrationdaemon.conf.dpkg-bak /etc/perfsonar/lsregistrationdaemon.conf
systemctl restart perfsonar-lsregistrationdaemon
```


### MaDDash

-  The PID file is now managed by systemd. This fixes issue where the maddash-server service would go into a failed state on update. 

### pScheduler

-  Updated systemd unit files to more reliably restart pscheduler services when postgresql restarts. This solves an issue where tests would all enter "Missed" state when postgresql was restarted.

### Toolkit

- Removed dependency on nscd and replaced with systemd-resolved for local DNS caching. This solves issue where IPv6 tests would fail because nscd would return bad results when performing IPv6 lookups.
