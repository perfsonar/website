Bug Fixes and Changes
---------------------

### pScheduler

-   Added *pscheduler internal service [start|stop|restart]* for
    starting/stopping/restarting all pscheduler services with single
    command
-   Report failed runs as failures instead of finished.
-   Gave the result command the ability to display the results of all
    runs in a task by supplying the task URL.
-   Updated *pscheduler troubleshoot* to better display MTU to localhost
-   Gave the result command the ability to display the results of all
    runs in a task by supplying the task URL.
-   Improved fetching of non-starting runs when using the CLI.
-   Gave the HTTP archiver the ability to provide headers to the server
    with automatic determination of Content-Type and Content-Length that
    can be overridden manually.

### pSConfig/Perl Shared Libraries

-   Fixed issue where psconfig would create multiple copies of some task
    when it was included in multiple pSConfig templates
-   Fixed incorrect iperf3 port in generated MaDDash reports. It was
    displaying 5101 in tips for fixing things but should have been 5201.

### MaDDash
