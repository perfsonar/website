Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}

Features
--------
### Throughput test support for loopback tests

- Added support to loopback (destination on same host) throughput tests to iperf2, nuttcp and ethr tools.

### Added support for AS to limits

- Added a ip-cymru-asn identifier to the limit system that checks if the requester's IP is within a list of autonomous system numbers (ASNs).

### Graphs Archive Whitelist

- Added support for configuring a list of measurement archives the graphs and tracerouteviewer are allowed to contact. Instructions for configuring can be found [here](http://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/4.4.0/manage_security.html#managing-archive-whitelist-for-graphs).

### New-from-the-ground-up RabbitMQ archiver.

- Added a timeout parameter to govern how long the RabbitMQ archiver will wait for RabbitMQ before giving up.

Other Bug Fixes and Changes
----------------------------

### pScheduler
- Removed support for the psurl tool, which has been superseded by the curl tool.
- pScheduler services are now more-closely managed by systemd, and failures can be found by consulting journalctl.
- Added the ability for the batch processor to default to using another host as lead when none is specified.
- Improved ability of services to continue working when unable to start new threads.
- Made the schedule plotter part of the REST API
- Better handle iperf3 tool test failures by looking at results on both ends
- Changed ethr to default to port 5201 to match other tools
- Fixed cpu affinity options for throughput tests using iperf3 and nuttcp tools.
- pScheduler is now running iperf3 tests with authentication.
- Added `--reverse-connections` switch for nuttcp throughput tests
- Added `--traverse-nat` option to latency test which translates to -Z in twping

### pSConfig
- Added support for contexts on single-ended tests
- Added check to make sure pScheduler references valid objects and can fallback to cache if something is incorrect.
- Fixed bug where archives only differing by private fields would lead pSConfig to recreate tasks on every run.

### pSConfig Web Administrator (PWA)
 - Fixed selecting "traceroute(default)" results in bwctltraceroute as an option
