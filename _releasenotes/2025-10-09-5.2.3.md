Released {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}

**NOTE: 5.2.3 is only available on RedHat-based operating systems. It contains a fix that currently only applies to those OSes, so no Debian release was made.**

Bug Fixes and Other Changes
---------------------

### pScheduler
- This release consists solely of an improved version of the ethr tool for pScheduler that uses Ethr 1.x and can interoperate with older systems with the incompatible Ethr 0.x installed. **Currently this is only available on Red Hat-based systems.** The plan is to add similar functionality to Debian-based systems in 5.2.4, but for now Debian will continue to use the older version of Ethr.
