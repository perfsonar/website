New Features
----------------------------
* **EL8 and EL9 Packages now in beta** - You can install RPMs for EL8 and EL9 by following [the instructions here](https://docs.perfsonar.net/install_el.html). The beta tag is just applied until we get wider testing, the packages live in our production RPM repos and we will remove that label once they have been run in the community for awhile.
