Dedication

perfSONAR 5.0 is dedicated to the memory of [Michael

who was a long-time contributor, colleague and friend.


Features/Highlighted Changes
--------
### New OpenSearch Archive Replaces esmond

- perfSONAR has removed the esmond software and now provides support for OpenSearch. **Existing data will NOT be migrated on update**. A full migration guide can be found [here](https://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/5.0.0/manage_update.html#upgrading-to-perfsonar-5-x).

- Full 5.0.0 documentation [here](https://docs.perfsonar.net/release_candidates/5.0.0).

### Note about OS support

- This beta is only available as RPMs for CentOS 7, but additional support for AlmaLinux 8, RockyLinux 8, Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 and Ubuntu 20 will be available in future betas prior to final release. Additionally, ISOs and docker images will be provided as a future beta.

Other Bug Fixes and Changes
----------------------------
### Bundles
- The centralmanagement bundle is no longer supported. See the perfsonar-archive package.
- Removed esmond dependencies and replaced with perfsonar-archive

### pScheduler
- Overhauled internal services to take advantage of more processor cores and overcome some of Python's multithreading limitations.
- All DNS-related behavior has been redone to comply with RFC 6724 or whatever the system's resolver is configured to do.
- Corrected a bug in the iperf2 tool plugin that caused UDP measurements to be made with TCP.
- Removed support for the test limit in the limit system.
- Added the ability for the batch processor to use a jq transform on job results to determine whether or not to proceed with the next job.
- Enhanced the Kafka archiver to add support for SSL connections, Kafka retries and an archiver ID to help identify the source in Kafka's server-side logs.
- Added a new udp archiver plugin for sending results as datagrams.
- If no nameserver parameter is supplied in a dns test, the dnspy tool divides the length of the timeout parameter evenly among the number of resolvers configured on the system. This is a behavior change from earlier versions.
- Added a new postgresql archiver plugin for inserting results into PostgreSQL tables.

### Toolkit

* Remove esmond references on UI and replaced with perfSONAR archive
* Fixed issue with services shown as not running when SELinux enabled.
* Updated default limits to match new pscheduler format for "test" limit type
