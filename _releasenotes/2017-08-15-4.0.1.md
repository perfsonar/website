Detailed Bug Fixes and Changes
------------------------------

### pScheduler

-   Added support for source, dest and endpoint limits to throughput,
    latency, latencybg, rtt and trace tests. These should allow test
    types to be limited to a single interface. The source and dest
    limits match their respective fields whereas the endpoint limit
    matches as long as one of the source OR dest is in the provided
    range.
-   pScheduler is now able to run on non-standard port. Testers can
    communicate with it using the source-node and dest-node options for
    tests
-   Added backup and restore scripts for pscheduler database
-   Added *pscheduler troubleshoot* command to help troubleshoot
    pscheduler problems
-   Made the scheduler multithreaded to limit effects of slow running
    jobs
-   Added stronger enforcement of schema version between pscheduler
    components
-   Added verification of privileges when sending ICMP probes with
    traceroute
-   Added configuration file for iperf2 tool plug-in
-   Added better error handling when no source interface detected
-   Removed Apache version from Apache generated pages
-   Better error handling when one end of multi-participant tests does
    not return JSON
-   Changed pscheduler-core dependency from gnuplot to gnuplot-minimal
-   Better error handling in esmond archiver when POST and PUT requests
    get redirection status codes
-   Fixed parsing and generation of IPv6 URLs in various places
-   Fixed ping tool to properly detect when it needs to use IPv6
-   Added API calls to validate archiver and test specifications
-   Added restart to database on python-pscheduler update
-   Added short form command-line options to trace and rtt task commands
-   Added reason for non-start status to *pscheduler schedule* command
    output
-   Added --color and --delta options to *pscheduler monitor* command
-   Added support for getting detailed list of tasks in one API call
    with expanded and detail options
-   Added commands to make sure pscheduler user account does not expire
-   Better error handling in iperf3 tool when no JSON returned
-   Improved calculation of bandwidth when applying limits
-   Esmond archiver registers histogram-rtt statistics summary with
    window 0 by default

### Bundles and Shared Libraries

-   Added additional perfsonar version information to the lookup service
    to beter track betas and release candidates
-   Added iproute to package requirements for bundles

### Esmond

-   Added workaround to make sure cassandra's pid directory gets created
    after reboot
-   Added esmond\_manage script so no longer need to switch to
    virtualenv by hand to perform management tasks.
-   Added support for event types packet-rtt, packet-rtt-subintervals,
    tcp-windowsize, tcp-windowsize-subintervals, streams-packet-rtt,
    streams-packet-rtt-subintervals, streams-tcp-windowsize, and
    streams-tcp-windowsize-subintervals
-   Fixed ps\_remove\_data.py to properly handle case where the -c
    option is not provided

### Graphs

-   Added dots over data points on hover
-   Properly falls-back if expected summary-window missing for
    histogram-rtt
-   Completely removed old graph files
-   Removed Net::Interface dependency
-   Using local copy of jQuery instead of version from CDN to avoid
    firewall issues
-   Added clickjacking mitigation HTTP headers
-   Cleaned-up handling of timezones and date parsing
-   Added 12 hour option to graphs with summary window 0
-   Fixed issues where failures would not always display on graphs

### LS Registration Daemon

-   Removed NDT and NPAD from list of services registered
-   Fixed typo in error message that incorrectly referred to
    configuration option
-   Removed Net::Interface dependency
-   Added host-os-architecture key that registers host processor
    architecture as standalone field

### MaDDash

-   Disable displaying Apache version in default page listings
-   Added maddash-server.env file where Java command-line options can be
    set that won't be overridden on update

### MeshConfig

-   Added bug fix to properly clear out global measurement archives set
    by pre-4.0 mesh-config agents
-   Removed outdated reference to pinger-landmarks file in error message
-   Fixed formatting of IPv6 addresses in URLs so they include square
    brackets. Generally occurred when a test endpoint was an IPv6
    address.
-   Greatly reduced the number of HTTP GET requests by using a bulk
    request to get list of pScheduler tasks

### Toolkit

-   Improved parsing of CPU speed
-   Removed lingering NDT/NPAD references
-   Fixed issue where forgetting the trailing / in /tookit/auth/ URL
    would not redirect to https on some hosts
-   Updated location abbreviations
-   Removed Apache version from generated pages and HTTP headers
-   Added nuttcp option for throughput tests
-   Added default bandwidth for UDP tests created on GUI
-   Fixed NTP restarts in configuration script to make sure all changes
    get applied
-   Added numerous HTTP security headers to help prevent cross-site
    scripting and other types of attacks. These do not address a
    specific threat, were just added as best practice.
-   Fixed inaccurate test counts on GUI
-   Updated NTP GUI to display reference ID from ntpq
-   Added two European servers to NTP server list in GUI
-   Created new perfsonar-toolkit-systemenv-testpoint package to handle
    basic host configuration for a testpoint not running httpd or other
    services
-   Moved apache security configuration to perfsonar-toolkit-security
    package
